# Arch Linux installation guide

My way to install Arch Linux manually.
- The main installation guide is in the *1_archinstall.md* file
- The other file (*2_de_setup.md*) is just for installing a desktop environment

## Explanation

- &ensp;***Tabbed*** sections (like this) are either **<ins>actions</ins>** (for example in cfdisk) or **<ins>config file edits</ins>** (using nano).
