# Arch Linux installation guide

My way to install Arch Linux manually.
The good stuff is in the ```archinstall.txt``` file:

## Explanation

- &ensp;***Tabbed*** sections (like this) are either **<ins>actions</ins>** (for example in cfdisk) or **<ins>config file edits</ins>** (using nano).

- And ***#*** -s are comments, of course.
